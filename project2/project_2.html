		So far we've only taught static visualizations. Which dynamic elements or interactions could improve your article?<br>
		A mockup is welcome. <br>
		
		I can think of one dynamic element that mainly works for the bar plot. Right now, we reduced<br>
		the number of years that we show the avarage temperature<br>
		of by only showing the even numbered years. This is because there were<br>
		simply to many data points. The bar plot was still visible,<br>
		although a little clutered. But it really cluttered the x axis labels.<br>
		To make it more visible we only show the even years. A cool dynamic element<br>
		would be that if you hover your mouse over a bar in the barplot,<br> 
		the bar would jump out. The bar can also be high lighted. Then it would also show the next 2 or<br>
		three years to the left and right of the bar.<br>
		Including the odd numbered years. It would be a sort of zoom in effect.<br>
